# ChessUnity
Chess game made with unity <br>
-----------------
Implemented all game mechanics, such as: <br>
* Moving pieces <br>
* Taking pieces <br>
* Checkmate <br>
* Stalemate <br>
* Castle <br>
* En passant <br>
* Pawn promotion <br>

Currently implementing a function to see all possible moves with X depth to see if all game rules are implemented 100% correctly <br>
Next i will implement a strong <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_engine">chess engine</a>, that will be in another repository
